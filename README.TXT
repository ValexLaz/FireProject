STOP FIRE BY TypeError a Project for NASA SPACE APPS CHALLENGE 2023
We developed an app concept that involves real time fire alerts and direct communication to fire departments. It also connects to dangerous gas sensors which are placed in rural areas to warn the communities of possible danger. 
Community-based fire management is addressed through the user based reports of fires through the app when they pop up on the live fire map. This solution aims to prevent tragedies in remote areas by enabling outsiders to report incidents when locals cannot.

HERE YOU CAN FIND THE COMPLETE PROJECT DEVELOPED IN JAVA AND XML USING THE FIRMS API.
